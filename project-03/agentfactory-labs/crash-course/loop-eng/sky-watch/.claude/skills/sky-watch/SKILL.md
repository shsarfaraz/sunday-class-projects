description: Write a forward-looking asteroid watch — which near-Earth objects pass in the next few days, which is closest, and whether NASA has flagged any as dangerous — by running this skill's bundled script, never from memory. Use it whenever the user asks what asteroids are coming, wants a sky watch or asteroid forecast, asks whether anything is going to hit or come close to Earth, or runs a scheduled job that reports on near-Earth objects. A watch warns before the pass, so always look ahead, never report a pass that has already happened.

# Sky watch

A watch earns its name by warning you _before_ something happens, not after. So
this skill always looks **ahead** — the next several days of asteroid close
approaches — and never reports a pass that is already in the past. "Yesterday an
asteroid nearly hit us" is a fact with no use in it.

The numbers are not guessable. Asteroid orbits are known, so NASA can say where
the rocks will be — but only NASA can. So the position always comes from the
bundled script, run fresh, every time.

## Getting the forecast

Run the script:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/sky-watch/scripts/skywatch.py
```

It fetches the next seven days of close approaches and prints a watch card:
what is coming, the single closest pass, and — first, if any — the objects NASA
has flagged as potentially hazardous. The script owns the API, the date window,
and the danger check, so none of that has to be remembered.

**Match the window to how often you run.** Add `--days N` to narrow it:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/sky-watch/scripts/skywatch.py --days 1   # today only
```

A **daily** watch should report **today** (`--days 1`) — if it sent the whole
next seven days every morning, six of them would just repeat yesterday. Use the
full seven-day window (the default) for a **by-hand** "what is coming this week?"
or a **weekly** schedule. So: run daily, report today; run weekly, report the
week.

For the raw numbers to reason with, ask for JSON:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/sky-watch/scripts/skywatch.py --json
```

When you are emailing the watch, use the HTML card as the email body — it draws
each pass as a proximity bar, closest first, so the reader sees the sky at a
glance:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/sky-watch/scripts/skywatch.py --html
```

Pass its output as the `htmlBody` of the email, and keep your one-line summary
as the plain-text body. Do not hand-write HTML — the script's card is
deterministic and email-safe; your job is still the framing sentence.

## Writing the watch

Turn the card into **one short, forward-looking paragraph** a person can read
over coffee and know whether to care. The shape:

1. **Lead with danger, or with calm.** If anything is flagged hazardous _and_
   actually close, say so first and plainly. If nothing is a real threat — the
   usual case — open by saying so. Do not bury "all clear" under a list.
2. **Name the closest pass, in Moons.** "23× the Moon's distance" means
   something; "8,918,882 km" does not. The script gives you both — use the Moon.
3. **Say when.** A watch is about the future, so dates matter: "on the 20th",
   "later this week".

**Example — a calm week:**

> Sky watch for the week ahead: nothing to worry about. Forty asteroids pass in
> the next seven days, and the closest, 2019 NG2 on the 20th, stays 23 times
> farther than the Moon. Two are on NASA's "potentially hazardous" list, but both
> pass beyond 170× the Moon — that label is about their orbits, not this trip.
> All clear.

**Example — the rare loud morning:**

> ⚠ Heads up: 2024 XY passes on the 22nd at just 1.8× the Moon's distance and is
> on NASA's hazardous list — the closest approach this month by far. It will miss,
> but it is worth watching. The rest of the week is quiet.

## One nuance to get right

"Potentially hazardous" is a **classification of the object's orbit** (it can
come within ~7.5 million km and is over ~140 m wide), not a claim that _this_
pass is dangerous. An object can carry the flag and still miss by 180× the Moon,
as most do. Always report the flag **and** the actual distance, so the reader
sees the difference. Never turn a routine flagged pass into a scare.

## When the fetch fails

The script exits non-zero and says so. Say the watch could not run this time, in
one line, and stop. Do not fill the sky with a remembered or guessed forecast —
a false "all clear" is the one thing a watch must never say. The next scheduled
run will try again.
