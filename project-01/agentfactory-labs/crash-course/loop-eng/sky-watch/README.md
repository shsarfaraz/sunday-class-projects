# The Sky Watch — a loop that runs while you sleep

**Loop Engineering, Concept 6 — unattended schedules.**

Every morning before you wake, a machine that isn't yours checks the sky and
leaves you a note: which asteroids are coming toward Earth in the next week, and
whether any of them are worth worrying about.

You start it once. After that it runs on a clock, with your laptop shut, whether
or not anything is happening up there.

## How this differs from the other three

The [ISS project](../iss-loop/) runs on **your** laptop and dies when you close
the terminal. This one runs on a schedule, on someone else's machine, and keeps
going while you sleep. That is the whole concept, in one contrast:

|                      | You start it  | It stops when                        |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| In-session (`/loop`) | you type      | you close the terminal               |
| **Scheduled (this)** | **the clock** | **you cancel it — never on its own** |

And unlike the [Doorbell](../doorbell/), which reacts _after_ a pull request
happens, this looks **forward**: it is midnight, here is the sky for the days
ahead. An event is a reflex. A schedule is a forecast.

## See it work right now

No schedule needed to try it. The forecast is just a script:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/sky-watch/scripts/skywatch.py
```

```
  ☄  SKY WATCH — next 7 days, from 2026-07-19
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     ✓  Nothing flagged hazardous in the window.

     Closest pass:  2019 NG2  on 2026-07-20
        8,918,882 km  =  23.2× the Moon
        ~40–90 m across, 49,775 km/h

     40 close approaches total in the next 7 days.
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Now make it a loop.

## Run it

### 1. Open it in Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panaversity/agentfactory-labs.git
cd agentfactory-labs/crash-course/loop-eng/sky-watch
claude
```

Say **yes** when Claude asks whether you trust the folder — that switches on the
pre-granted permission so the watch never stops to ask. Then try it once by hand:

```
what asteroids are coming this week?
```

It runs the `sky-watch` skill, calls NASA, and writes you a forward-looking
watch — one plain paragraph, danger first or calm first. Prove it works before
you schedule it.

### More starter prompts

You just ran the basic watch. Here are three more — each said the way you would
ask a person, because the skill carries the detail so your words can stay plain:

```
is anything dangerous heading toward Earth in the next few days?
```

Same data, framed as the question you actually care about. Watch it lead with
the danger flag if there is one — and, more often, reassure you there is not.

```
what is the single closest asteroid this week, and how does its distance compare to the Moon?
```

Pins it to one object and one comparison. "23× the Moon" is the number that
means something; this is how you teach the loop to always translate to it.

```
give me this week's sky watch, and if anything is flagged hazardous, explain what that label actually means
```

Draws out the one nuance NASA data hides: "potentially hazardous" is about an
object's orbit, not this particular pass. A good watch says the flag _and_ the
real distance.

Once one of these reads right by hand, you are ready to put it on a clock.

### 2. Turn it into a schedule

Now the heartbeat. Take any starter prompt above and hand it to `/schedule`:

```
/schedule every day at midnight, run the sky-watch skill for today and write me the forecast
```

That creates a **cloud Routine** — it runs on Anthropic's servers, so it fires
at midnight whether your laptop is open, asleep, or in a bag. Once a day is well
under the daily run cap.

**Match the window to the cadence.** Notice the prompt says _today_, not "the
week ahead." A daily run should report the day it fires — if it re-sent the whole
next seven days every morning, six of those days would just repeat yesterday's
email. Run daily, get today. (Curious about the days beyond? Ask by hand any
time: _"what's coming this week?"_)

One variant worth trying, because it is the real shape of a watch:

```
/schedule every day at 8am, run the sky-watch skill for today — but only message me if something is flagged hazardous
```

Silent when the sky is clear, loud only when it is not. It still fires every day;
it just decides whether the day is worth your attention.

### 3. Prove it fast, then trust it overnight

A schedule is slow to prove — you cannot watch midnight arrive. So do not trust
it overnight until you have watched it fire once, fast:

1. Fire a one-off now to rehearse: `/schedule in 2 minutes, run the sky-watch skill`.
   A one-off does not count against your daily cap. Watch it run.
2. When that looks right, leave the midnight schedule on and go to bed.
3. In the morning, the watch is waiting.

That ladder — **prove it hourly and watched before you trust it nightly and
unattended** — is the rule from Part 6 of the course, made physical.

## Getting it by email (so you wake up to it)

A watch you have to open a browser to read is only half a watch. The real thing
lands in your inbox before you are awake. A Routine does this through a
**connector** — not a script with an email password (that could never live in a
public repo), but a channel you attach to the Routine on the web. The credentials
stay in your Claude account; the repo stays clean.

The mechanism, in four steps:

1. **Connect a channel** at [`claude.ai/customize/connectors`](https://claude.ai/customize/connectors) — Gmail, or Slack.
2. **Open your Routine** at [`claude.ai/code/routines`](https://claude.ai/code/routines). (You can create a schedule with `/schedule` in the CLI, but connectors are attached on the web — the CLI cannot do it.)
3. **Attach the connector** to this Routine, and only this one. A connector is a permission: with no email connector attached, the Routine could not email you even if the prompt asked.
4. **Add one line to the prompt:** _"…then email me the forecast at you@example.com, subject 'Sky Watch'."_

Fire a one-off to test (`/schedule in 2 minutes, run the sky-watch skill and email me the result`) and check that it arrives.

**Make it a picture, not a paragraph.** The script can render the watch as a
self-contained HTML card — each pass drawn as a proximity bar, closest first, so
you take in the whole sky at a glance:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/sky-watch/scripts/skywatch.py --html > watch.html && open watch.html
```

Ask the loop to use that as the email body — _"…email me the forecast, using the
HTML card as the body"_ — and the morning note arrives as a visual, not a wall of
text.

> **One honest limit.** The built-in **Gmail** connector can _draft_ but not
> _send_ — so with Gmail, each morning's watch lands in your **Drafts** folder,
> not your inbox. That is still delivery, just one click short. For a message that
> truly arrives on its own, use **Slack** (it delivers), or an email connector
> that supports sending. Check what your chosen connector can actually do before
> you rely on it — a Routine can only use the tools its connector gives it.

## What "all clear" means, and why it is the point

Most mornings, the watch will say some version of "nothing dangerous, nearest
pass is 20× the Moon, all clear." **That is not the loop failing — that is the
loop working.** A night watch earns its keep by being quiet on the quiet days and
loud on the one day it matters. An event-driven loop would say nothing at all on
a calm day. A schedule reports anyway — that is what makes it a _watch_.

When something genuinely close does appear, the same loop leads with it:

> ⚠ Heads up: 2024 XY passes on the 22nd at 1.8× the Moon and is on NASA's
> hazardous list — the closest this month. It will miss, but worth watching.

## The one nuance NASA data will trip you on

Some asteroids carry a **"potentially hazardous"** flag and still miss by 180×
the Moon. That flag describes the object's _orbit_ (it can come within ~7.5
million km and is over ~140 m wide), not this particular pass. The watch always
shows the flag **and** the real distance, so you can see the difference. Do not
let a routine flagged pass become a false alarm.

## Rate limits

The script uses NASA's shared `DEMO_KEY` by default — fine to start, but rate-
limited, so a burst of test runs may get throttled. Grab a free personal key at
[api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov) (instant, just an email) and set it:

```bash
export NASA_API_KEY=your-key-here
```
